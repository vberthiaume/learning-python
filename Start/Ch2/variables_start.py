# LinkedIn Learning Python course by Joe Marini
# Example file for variables and basic types


# Basic data types in Python: Numbers, Strings, Booleans 
# Variable names must start with a letter or _, and can have numbers. They are case sensitive. 
myint = 10
myfloat = 13.2576
mystr = "This is a string"
mybool = True

# We can display the content of a variable using the print() function
# print ("nom " * 3)      # this works
# print ("nom " + 3)    # but this doesn't!

# Operators are used to perform operations on variables


# Logical and comparison operators 
print (not True)    # the inverse boolean operator is "not", and not "!" lol


# re-declaring a variable works
